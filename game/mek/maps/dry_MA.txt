description
This map plays in a desert, a death valley, maybe on a far planet. 
I tried to have the proportions of mechs in mind, while creating.Because I don't know how Mek Arcade will evolve, this comes in a basic layout only. No special entities or powerup placements. The only used light is a skylight until now. There should also be room for Mek Arcade's special mapmodels, which may come someday... .
