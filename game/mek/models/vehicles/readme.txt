50 Vehicles to Play

Actually, there are a few more than that. All squished into 10 MB. Incredible.

Here is a prealpha, pre Xmas present for you all.

Over 50 vehicle models, in only 10 MB! 

They are configured and ready to go in RE, and when we say 'game ready' we mean it. There is even a sample RE map displaying them.  There is a readme file which describes the models and any issues.

You may ask how did we fit so manymodels in such a small package?

- md3 are usually the smallest file size of the cube supported formats 
- reuse of textures and meshes
- use of jpg instead of png 
- most don't have normals or masks
- low res texturing

[b]Important Note: [/b]The models are designed to be displayed about 20% of the size you see in the sample map, hence we have been a  You will understand why we don't really need to improve the texture work for mekArcade.  
 
[b]Setting [/b]They range from late 20C onwards. 

[b]Format: [/b] Most are md3 format, a couple in md5 in preparation for animation.

[b]Artists [/b] About half are our own and most of the rest are derived from W. Sitters collection. There are a couple of 'uncertain origin' and I am trying to track down the artist/licence.

[b]Yet another Important Note: [/b]Because I haven't sorted out all the licences I don't want a full public release, or put them up at Quad (I don't want Suicizer to tell me off)

[b]Plan for these models[/b]
1. Convert most to md5
2. Animate with a various destroyed animation, eg kicked over, crushed and maybe an explosion. 
3. Work on developing a better, more consistent SciFi look.  

I expect a bit more than half will appear in MekArcade in their destructible form. I am hoping we can develop one set of animations, then autorig them to the different meshes and import the animations. Fingers crossed. 

The remainder of the week is going to be spent on destructibles, I have a nice tree that sways and falls over and I am going to try rigging it up to some other tree meshes. If that goes OK I will move on to making destructible signs and lamp posts, then buildings. 

As always, if anyone wants to help contact me. I can provide the misfit models for the md5.

Enjoy!
