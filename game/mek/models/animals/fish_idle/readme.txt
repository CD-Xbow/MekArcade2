The original mesh was the trout.md3, and I don't know where it came from and there was 
no skin. I have provided a couple of quick skins, which could be improved.  

If you are the original artist please contact me at cdxbow@yahoo.com.au and clarify the 
licensing.  

I used the transform function in Misfit Cubed to make the dogfish (2) and short fish (3) from the
original trout md3 mesh. it's one of the few things you can do to an animated md3, and it's 
success is hit and miss.

Fish 1 and 1a are the same old trout, same animation, but one runs a bit slower, so it looks 
more natural when the fish all don't move identically.

Include them in your map in the usual way. The md3.cfg are set to do the mapmodel animation

mmodel "fish_idle/1"
mmodel "fish_idle/1a"
mmodel "fish_idle/2"
mmodel "fish_idle/3"
